**Phase 2 of the project**  
**1. Chosen Development Model:**

- **Model:** Agile

- **Justification:** Agile is preferred because it can adjust to
  shifting needs and provide iterative feedback, which is essential to
  creating a platform that promotes skill development and career growth.
  It makes it possible to respond to the demands of stakeholders and
  continuously develop.  
  **2. User Requirements:**

    prospects.

  - **Clients:** Organizations seeking efficient talent management
    solutions.

  - **Developers:** The Tech Tribe team tasked with building and
    updating the platform.

<!-- -->

- **User Stories:**

  - **End-User (Employee):** "As an employee, I want to create a
    comprehensive profile of my skills and career goals to find relevant
    skill development opportunities."

  - **HR Manager (Client):** "As an HR manager, I want to access
    detailed analytics on workforce skills and development needs to
    better plan training programs."  
    **3. Functional Requirements:**

    their skills, experiences, and ambitions.

  - **Acceptance Criteria:** Users can add, edit, and delete skills and
    objectives from their profile.

<!-- -->

- **Career Progression Tracker:**

  - **Description:** Introduce a feature to track and visualize
    employees' career progression, including completed trainings,
    certifications, and skill advancements.

  - **Acceptance Criteria:** Employees can view their career progression
    timeline, adding new achievements and setting future goals.  
    **4. Non-Functional Requirements:**

<!-- -->

- **Performance:**

  - **Description:** The platform must be fast and responsive to ensure
    a seamless experience.

  - **Acceptance Criteria:** Page load times should be under 2 seconds
    across the platform.

<!-- -->

- **Usability:**

  - **Description:** The platform's design should be intuitive, allowing
    users to navigate easily.

  - **Acceptance Criteria:** Users can use all features without
    requiring instructional support.  
    **5. Application Specifications:**

<!-- -->

- **Architecture:** The platform will employ a microservices
  architecture, promoting scalability and the flexibility to extend or
  modify services as needed without impacting the overall system.

- **Database Model:** MongoDB, a NoSQL database, will be utilized for
  its scalability, flexibility, and the ability to store data in a more
  unstructured format. This choice supports rapid development and the
  easy integration of data types as the platform evolves.

- **Technologies Used:**

  - **Frontend:** Angular is selected for its comprehensive framework
    capabilities, enabling the creation of dynamic, modular, and
    reactive user interfaces. Angular's ecosystem provides robust tools
    and components that streamline development and enhance user
    experience.

  - **Backend:** Node.js with Express framework will be used for the
    backend development, chosen for its non-blocking I/O model, which
    facilitates efficient data processing and scalability.

  - **Database:** MongoDB will be used for the database to leverage its
    flexible schema design, which is ideal for managing the diverse data
    types associated with user profiles, skills, and career progression.

<!-- -->

- **User Interface Design:** Figma will be employed for designing the
  user interface due to its collaborative features, allowing team
  members to work together in real-time, share designs with stakeholders
  for immediate feedback, and ensure a cohesive visual and functional
  design across the platform.

- **Security Measures:** The platform will incorporate comprehensive
  security measures to protect user data and ensure system integrity.
  This includes:

  - **Data Encryption:** Utilizing TLS/SSL for data in transit and AES
    for data at rest to ensure that all user data is encrypted and
    secure.

  - **Authentication and Authorization:** Implementing JWT (JSON Web
    Tokens) for secure and efficient user authentication and
    authorization, ensuring that users can only access data and features
    relevant to their roles.

  - **Input Validation:** Employing strict input validation to prevent
    SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other common web
    vulnerabilities.

  - **Regular Security Audits:** Conducting regular security audits and
    vulnerability scanning to identify and mitigate potential security
    risks promptly.

  - **Rate Limiting and Monitoring:** Implementing rate limiting to
    prevent abuse and DDoS attacks, along with continuous monitoring of
    system activity to detect and respond to unusual patterns or
    potential security breaches.  
    These application specifications detail the technological and
    security foundations upon which the Employee Skills and Career
    Development Platform will be built, ensuring a robust, secure, and
    user-friendly solution for career management and skill development.
